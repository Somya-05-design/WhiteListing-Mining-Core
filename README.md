WhiteListing-Minting_Core Smart Contract
A core engine for intelligent whitelist mining and management. This project focuses on identifying, extracting, and maintaining safe entities (such as IPs, domains, addresses, or users) from large datasets using rule-based logic, machine learning models, or behavioral heuristics. Designed for integration with cybersecurity tools, data pipelines, and threat detection systems, this engine serves as the backbone for building smarter, safer access controls.

Features:
🔍 High-performance data scanning and filtering

🧠 Adaptive whitelist detection using configurable logic or AI-based models

🔒 Secure and scalable whitelist storage

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Somya-05-design/WhiteListing-Mining-Core.git
cd ProjectName
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
PRIVATEKEY="your_core_wallet_private_key"
CORE_TEST2_SCAN_KEY="your_testnet2_explorer_api_key"
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Never share your private key or commit the `.env` file to version control.

## 🛠 Hardhat Commands

### Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy Contract

Use a deployment script:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network core_testnet2
```

---

## 🔍 Contract Verification

You can verify contracts using Core block explorers:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network core_testnet2 <deployed_contract_address> <constructor_args_if_any>
```

API keys for verification must be included in `.env` as shown above.
