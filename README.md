# WhiteListing-Mining-Core
A core engine for intelligent whitelist mining and management. This project focuses on identifying, extracting, and maintaining safe entities (such as IPs, domains, addresses, or users) from large datasets using rule-based logic, machine learning models, or behavioral heuristics. Designed for integration with cybersecurity tools, data pipelines, and threat detection systems, this engine serves as the backbone for building smarter, safer access controls.

Features:
🔍 High-performance data scanning and filtering

🧠 Adaptive whitelist detection using configurable logic or AI-based models

🔒 Secure and scalable whitelist storage
